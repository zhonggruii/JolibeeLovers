The aim of our Orbital Project is to develop a web application that streamlines the process of forming project groups for National University of Singapore (NUS) students with no connections in a particular module, helping users find effective and harmonious teammates.


## Description
For many students in NUS, finding groupmates to bid and complete modules with, can be a difficult and cumbersome task. As a result, many jump head first into modules without a pre-planned group and suffer tremendously when strangers-turned-groupmates do not share the same academic goals and visions, leading to the quality of work produced being shoddy and less than desired.

Our journey was exactly the same and occurred for the “IS1108” module, where we faced the challenge of finding reliable groupmates to bid for the module with. Many of our friends from CAPT were not from the School of Computing (SOC), leaving us to bid for the module on our own and scramble to form groups afterward. This uncertainty in group formation made it difficult to establish a shared standard of work, as each member had different expectations and levels of commitment. The lack of a centralized platform to connect with like-minded peers added unnecessary stress and inefficiency to the process.

This experience inspired us to create a solution that simplifies the creation of groups for students. We believe that with our web app, students will be able to find compatible groupmates effortlessly, ensuring that teams are formed based on shared goals, skills, and expectations. By fostering better collaboration and reducing the friction of group formation, our platform aims to enhance the overall learning experience and empower students to achieve their academic goals together.
